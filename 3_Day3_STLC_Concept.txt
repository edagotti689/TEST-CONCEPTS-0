Day3:

 Test Process in Software Testing

* It is a process rather than a single activity.
* Quality and effectivess of an application is depends Test process followed.

     Phases:
  
  % Planning and Control
     - Objectives and scope of testing (Planning)
  - Deviatiosn in the planning will do controlling
  
  % Analysis and Design
     - Review and analiyze user documents (Analysis)
  - Preparation Test design actives (Test Scenarios and Test cases writing)
  
  % Implementation and Execution
     - Test data prepartion and Migartion of Dev code to QA Environment.
  - Test the application by comparing Actual results (Application) with Expected results (Test cases).
  
  % Evaluting Exit criteria and Reporting
        - Will check the exit criteria reports for all the phases.


                                  Entry Criteia                                       Exit Criteria

                                    User Ideas      Test Requriments               Test requirement Document
        Test requirement Document Test planning                  Test plan document
        Test plan document    Test Designing                 Test scenarios and Test Cases prepared
    Test scenarios and Test Cases prepared Test Execution                 Test Execution reports    
        Test Execution reports    Test closure activities        Test reports
  
  % Test Closure Activities
     - Generate the reports to show how test process has been done.
  
  
  
  



 STLC (Software Testing Life Cyle)

It deals with Test related activities.. 

- Phases in STLC:
         ^ Test Requirements
      -Here it contains user expectations.
   -If QA Team has any questions, this will be answered by BA (Business Analyst)
   - Differnet comapries will call requiremts as: 
                  (Used in Non Agile)- BRD (Business Requirement Document)
         (Used in Non Agile)- SRS (System Requirement Specification)
         (Used in Non Agile)- FRD (Functional Requirement Document)
         (Used in Non Agile)- User Manual
         (Used in Non Agile)- Use Cases
         (Used in Non Agile)- Excel sheets (Smmaler orgazitions will use this)
                          User stories (Only in Agile)
  
   
   ^ Test planning
     - Here estimatiosn of the project will be discuseed.
     - Necessary information, scope, objectives, risks, team role and resposibilites.
     
   ^ Test Designing
     - Wil write Test scenariosn and Test cases (Preparation)
     - Test data is also considered.
     
   ^ Test Execution
     - Exectuign the application by comparing Actual Results with Expected results.
     - If any deviation from Actual results for Expected results, then the Test cases shoud be "FAIL", this information will be send to Dev team.
     - Else if Expected result is equal to Actual Result, then the correspoding Test cases should be "PASSED".
     
   ^ Test Closure Activities.
   
     - Here QA Team will generate Test reports to show how test process has been implemented.
     - Other names of Test reports are:
                  $ Test Summary Reports.
      $ Test closure reports.
      $ Test Status reports.
      $ Test Post Mortem Reports.

WHEN TO STOP TESTING?

@ When product meets user expectations
@ Any new update is as per user needs.
@ When project got cancelled.
